# RocketLander: Reinforcement Learning-Based Rocket Landing Control System

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to the development and optimization of a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based control system designed for the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket lander. The primary objective is to achieve autonomous and precise landings on predefined target zones, with the overarching goal of reducing mission costs and enhancing the reusability of the rocket.

## Motivation
The impetus for this project is drawn from the remarkable strides made by SpaceX in the realm of reusable launch vehicles. This endeavor explores the integration of reinforcement learning to address the intricate challenges associated with rocket recycling. The continual pursuit of efficiency and cost-effectiveness within the aerospace industry propels the evolution of sophisticated control systems for reusable rockets.

## Dynamics and Challenges of the Environment
### State Space
In the Rocket Lander environment, crucial variables include the rocket's position, orientation, leg ground contact indicators, engine gimbal angle, and velocity. These parameters play a pivotal role in guiding the RL agent's decision-making process during the landing sequence.

### Action Space
The action space delineates the spectrum of actions available to the RL agent, encompassing adjustments to the gimbal, throttle control, and maneuvers using control thrusters. These actions empower the agent to exert influence over the rocket's trajectory and orientation.

### Reward System
The reward system serves as a guide for the RL agent's learning process, consisting of a foundational reward and nuanced shaping based on factors such as distance, speed, angle, and ground contact. Additional penalties are incorporated to strategically guide the agent towards achieving efficient and stable landings.





## Usage
The repository includes code for training and testing the RL agent in the RocketLander environment. Users can explore diverse landing scenarios and control strategies by manipulating gimbal angles, throttle levels, and control thruster intensities.
